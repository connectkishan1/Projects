###  [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/connectkishan1/Titanic_Dataset_Prediction)
<!--[Github](https://github.com/connectkishan1/Titanic_Dataset_Prediction) | [nbviewer]()-->

* Project for the kaggle competitions
* Participation of the kaggle competition [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/)
* We were graded on leaderboard scores and I scored 7th of the class with position 1266th of the leaderboard
* I used a weighted average of Logistic regression, Random forest & SVM.
* The focus of this project was mostly on feature engineering
